## Demographic noise and neutral drift

### Introduction

The demographic noise is modeled as an additive stochastic term, noise term, in the spatio-temporal differential equation for the population biomass. This type of noise scales as square root of the population size. The differential equation that governs the dynamics of the biomass of each species becomes:

\begin{align}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{align}
