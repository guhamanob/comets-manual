One of the main features of COMETS is the ability to perform simulations 
where microbes grow in a spatially structured environment. One of the simplest 
demonstrations of this is simulating the growth of colonies on a 2D surface, for 
example an agar plate


## Changing biomass propagation: swimming and swarming


## Simulations in 3D environments
